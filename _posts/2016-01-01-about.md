I am currently a research scientist in the [Storey Lab][4] at Princeton University. The main focus of the lab is on high-dimensional data analysis in genomics. My general interests are in the following topics:

  * Developing statistical models for high-dimensional data 
  * Meta-analysis studies
  * Writing R packages
  * Reproducible research

Please see my [Research][3], [R packages][1], or [GitHub][6] page for additional details.
